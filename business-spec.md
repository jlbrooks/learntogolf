### Play 9 holes from Level 1
You will start by playing nine holes from Level 1, where the course is 225 yards long, meaning 25 yards per hole. Every hole is a Par 4, which is your target amount of strokes to hole the ball. Do this for 9 holes to shoot 36!

### Shoot 36 or Better to Level Up
Your goal is to shoot 36 or better for nine holes. When you achieve this, you level up and the course gets progressively longer. This helps you gradually develop your skills without feeling overwhelmed.
